# Plan

What is open, in priority order. Only `scribe` edits this file.

Each item: one line of what, one line of why it matters, and its blocker if it
has one. When an item is in flight, mark it with its task ids. Delete items you
no longer want rather than letting them rot — a plan nobody trusts is worse
than no plan.

## Now

### Tool-pack foundation and v13/v14 acceptance complete
Tasks 20b–20f, the P1 toolset follow-up and bridge fix are merged through PRs #42–51. Full v14 acceptance passed all 35 tests, including the disabled Hello Pack case; enabled and disabled v14 lifecycle checks also passed separately.

Foundry v13.351 / PF2e 7.12.2 now passed all 34 core/read/multi-user tests with zero failures and zero leaks (20 player results × 21 hidden strings). The optional Hello Pack test skipped; no v13 pack lifecycle claim is made. Harness selector PR #53 is a dependency of this record. The earlier deferral is superseded by this configured-instance evidence. Tasks 15, 17 and 18 remain open; task 15 is in implementation and task 17 is ready next. Run 15 → 17 → 21 serially where runtime files overlap; task 21 follows the approval dialog and merged tool-pack foundation.

Task 21 is implemented in draft PR #57 with offline verification; native world-write acceptance is not yet approved or run. Its delayed-approval SDK proof is blocked by task 21a: add the generic MCP-only output envelope projection so a client that first lists tools accepts legitimate pending approval results. Task 21a depends on 16/20e and can base on current main independently of task 21.

Task 18 is architecture-blocked: immediate gateway token invalidation for another owner, including while that owner is offline, lacks trusted cross-owner attestation. Preserve that acceptance requirement; hello role hints cannot authorize it. Design a trusted gateway-controlled observer prerequisite before implementing 18; this introduces a production browser/credential/configuration surface and needs a deliberate future contract. Do not add an 18 → 36 dependency cycle or silently substitute pending revocation.

### Testing topology and prerequisites
- Implementation happens on the homelab; client-side and browser tests run in Andrew's Mac test-bed Claude session (clone at `~/workspace/foundry-modules/agent-gateway`). Use `/usr/bin/curl` there, since Anaconda curl ignores the keychain.
- The test-world users are dev-gm (GM), player1 and Player2. The harness matches user names case-insensitively on the join screen, preferring an exact match; set FOUNDRY_PLAYER2_USER=Player2 to match the world's spelling exactly. The test users have no password; the per-user `FOUNDRY_{GM,PLAYER,PLAYER2}_PASSWORD` variables are optional.
- The harness reads settings from `~/.config/agent-gateway/test.env` (KEY=value lines; the environment wins). FOUNDRY_URL, FOUNDRY_WORLD, FOUNDRY_GM_USER, FOUNDRY_PLAYER_USER, FOUNDRY_PLAYER2_USER and the optional per-user password variables can be set there or in the environment; the legacy FOUNDRY_PASSWORD is ignored with a warning. See docs/testing.md for the full list.
- Pairing is a one-time headed `npm run test:e2e:setup` in which Andrew types each pairing code; the harness never types one. State lives in `~/.config/agent-gateway/e2e/`.
- After setup the Mac runs `npm run test:e2e` unattended, under an exact allow rule from Andrew in its auto mode.
- A newly linked module only appears after `test-world` is relaunched from the setup screen (admin key, Andrew only).
- **Validated:** v13.351 and v14.369 core/read/multi-user suites passed; Hello Pack lifecycle acceptance is proven on v14. See docs/testing.md for fresh-world prerequisites.
- Criterion 11 of task 01 was checked with a console capture that missed about 617 early boot messages; a full Playwright capture from first load is in progress on the Mac and may be added to the PR.

## Next

### Pointer for task 36
36 must use the 10b recommendation (docs/spikes/foundry-socket-identity.md); identity only from server-set args; v13 re-check list in the spike.

### Follow-ups from wave 2
- Handshake mismatch message must name "module" and "gateway", not "local/remote side" (pick up in task 06 or 07). The user needs to know which side to update.
- Link version regex is not end-anchored (`1.0.0garbage` parses as major 1); tighten when 06 or 07 touches it.
- Confirm `result.structured` being optional is what the tool framework wants.
- `hasSceneLevels()` is tree-shaken out of the bundle (unused), so its runtime result is unverified live. Verify once a task uses it, for example by exposing it through the module api or a log line.
- Compat isolation test should also catch `game['release']`, destructuring and `game.version`; `foundryGeneration()` silently returns 13 if `game.release` is missing.
- Task 04 now has live v13.351 evidence through the full core/read/multi-user gate; retain task-specific follow-ups independently.
- Task 01b's task file was never committed (only HISTORY records it). Future mid-wave tasks put their task file in their PR.

### Follow-ups from task 05
- `gateway/test/mcp/server.test.ts:70` waits a fixed 1500 ms; wait for the id:2 response line instead, or it can flake.
- The CLI tests need a prior build; `npm run verify` builds first, but a bare `npm test` on a clean tree will fail them.
- The published npm package `foundry-agent-gateway` depends on the private workspace `@agent-gateway/protocol`. Bundle it at build time (release task 41) or publish it.

### Follow-ups from task 06
- `gateway/package.json` lacks `@agent-gateway/protocol` as a dependency; bundle it for release (task 41).
- Add a rate limit on pairing-code attempts if `allowNonLoopback` is ever used; loopback-only makes guessing impractical today.
- Implementers must run the full `npm run verify` before reporting done. Two attempts in this wave failed on that alone.

### Follow-ups from task 07
- A rejected code is never visible when a token is stored: status goes Connecting to Connected in about 0.3 s. Show a one-off notification that the code was not accepted.
- After a rejected code, retries keep re-sending it before the token fallback. Drop the code once it is rejected.
- Verify Local Network Access behaviour once in Andrew's everyday Chrome profile. The live proof used a fresh profile only.
- Foundry test stubs: `ApplicationV2` is empty, so pairing app rendering is covered only by the live check.
- Rename the test at `module/test/link/client.test.ts:276`; it covers the throw path only, not all reply paths.
- Add a dedicated "replaced" close code in `protocol/`, shared by gateway and module, instead of matching 1000 plus the reason string `replaced`.
- Submitting an empty gateway URL in the pairing app is a silent no-op; show a message.
- The `gatewayUrl` setting has no `onChange`; editing it in Foundry's core settings does nothing until Connect or a reload.
- One unexplained Tab-B load stall was seen once with bfcache enabled; it did not reproduce with diagnostics on. Watch for it.
- The pairing test's fake `querySelector` is permissive; tighten it so a wrong selector fails.
- The reload test should also assert the registered setting type is String and that the token is sent in hello after a reload.
- The `stringStorage` stub change replaced an existing line; keep stubs additive.
- A newer code entered between two stops during a pending welcome write is dropped in favour of the older-issued token. Same gateway, nothing leaks.
- A socket closing during the welcome write retries the used code once before the token fallback (one extra round trip).

### Follow-ups from task 08
- Separators after empty cells in flattened tables (`/ /`, `; ;`).
- A UUID split across cells is stitched with a separator.
- The deep-nesting scaling test misses cheap O(depth)-per-node work.
- A quadratic `@UUID` scan is detected only as a hang, since synchronous code cannot be interrupted by a vitest timeout; it is not a clean failure.
- `_` and `*` are escaped intra-word and inside bare URLs, which hurts readability.
- `#` and `>` after newlines inside `<pre>` are not handled.
- Relative links are resolved against a dummy root, so deep `../` is normalised.
- GFM autolinks of bare URLs are typed as text.
- Other-module data outside `flags` is still not filtered: ActiveEffect `changes[].key`, `_stats.compendiumSource`/`duplicateSource`, and module-written `system` fields, including objects named `system` outside schema system data.
- Duplicate SPACING oracle cases: the second template ignores `b`, and no case has trailing whitespace inside the second element.
- The generated-case skip filter can narrow to text containing `](`, because marked mis-parses `\](` in link text.
- `<pre>` content inside indented code blocks shows escape backslashes literally (`\<`, `\&`, `\*`); readability only.
- Intra-word emphasis fidelity: `x<em>*star </em>y` becomes `x*\*star* y`, where emphasis does not open after a word character (it reads `x**star*`).
- Fidelity: literal `**` or `*` can appear from nested same-delimiter emphasis or punctuation-adjacent emphasis.
- Multi-segment words can split across pages at small limits.
- The scaling oracle samples every 2nd/8th/16th/80th item of some corpora (half of SPLIT_TAGS, PROBES and ANCHORS are uncovered) to fit the time budget.
- Full verify takes about 65 s (slow suite about 51 s); review the budget if it grows.
- The paging oracle tolerates `*` in word comparison.

### Follow-ups from wave 4
- `chat_read` drops roll flavour, even for the GM.
- `chat_read` renders only the first roll of a message.
- Plain tool text shows markdown escapes (`8\.6.0`).
- LIMITED journals are "not found" for players, stricter than Foundry, which shows the title.
- Players cannot get the active Scene without ownership, stricter than Foundry.
- A same-millisecond duplicate can appear after a deleted paging anchor.
- Players have no scene layout until task 22, which must apply vision.
- `gateway/src/mcp/server.ts` and `EmptyModuleConnections` are unused; remove them.
- Name-collision denial of service on `--user <name>`: bind by id instead.
- Task 36 must prove the claimed identity at pairing per spike 10b, and must add pairing revocation (11b already ignores revoked pairings).
- v13 evidence is still pending for 09, 10 and 11.

### Follow-ups from task 12
- The summary JSON should include the run duration and the e2e-unit count.
- The seed counts do not list Tokens.
- The roles suite takes about 44 s because of per-role gateway restarts.
- Lint e2e with `npx eslint e2e`; `scripts/` holds only .sh files, so `npx eslint e2e scripts` no longer applies.
- v13 is still pending for all e2e suites.
